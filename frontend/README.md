# About
This project was made to simulate on how vending machine works. The backend is the API for the vending machine[see endpoint docs here](https://github.com/Ndkkqueenie/vending_machine_api/tree/main/backend#readme), allowing users with a “seller” role to add, update or remove products, while users with a “buyer” role can deposit coins into the machine and make purchases.. Frontend is made with React (JavaScript) and backend is made using Nodejs, Express and MongoDB.
